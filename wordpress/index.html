			As the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly around the world, few countries were already in such a state of
			<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/04/04/venezuelas-humanitarian-emergency/large-scale-un-response-needed-address-health">
				humanitarian crisis
			</a>
			as Venezuela. The precarious nature of its economy and society extended to the information landscape—in
			large part due to a decade-long effort by Venezuelan authorities to force radio stations off the air.
			<br>
			<br>
			Under the late President Hugo Chávez and his successor, Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan authorities have
			cracked down ever harder on the country’s independent media, amid a larger campaign to repress
			<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/venezuela">political dissent</a>
			and
			<a href="https://www.hrw.org/americas/venezuela">human rights activists</a>
			. The Committee to Protect Journalists has
			<a href="https://cpj.org/americas/venezuela/">documented</a>
			the implementation of a raft of restrictive measures, as well as the arrest and harassment of journalists,
			that have left the Venezuelan media weakened and in decline.
			<br>
			<br>
			In August 2009, the Chávez regime
			<a href="https://cpj.org/2009/08/34-radio-stations-pulled-off-the-air-in-venezuela/">canceled</a>
			the licenses of
			<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/venezuelan-government-closes-down-radio-stations/a-453480234">32 radio
				stations
			</a>
			in a single day, touching off a wave of closures over the next decade through overt censorship and other
			factors.

			According to data compiled by Venezuelan press freedom group
			<a href="http://espaciopublico.ong/">Espacio Público</a>
			and shared with CPJ, 180 radio stations that provided news and information went off the air between 2009 and
			2019. The vast majority of cases are straightforward
			<a href="http://espaciopublico.ong/conatel-incauto-los-equipos-de-radio-jet-95-3-fm-en-falcon/">shutdowns
			</a>
			by authorities , who pull stations off the air for a myriad of alleged violations, such as

			legal provisions or expired
			<a href="http://espaciopublico.ong/conatel-saca-del-aire-a-radio-medano-95-5-fm/">licenses</a>
			. In other cases, local authorities
			<a href="http://espaciopublico.ong/cortes-intencionales-de-luz-dejan-fuera-del-aire-a-dos-emisoras-en-tucupita/">
				purposely cut off power
			</a>
			. Some stations were pushed off the air due to a lack of basic services, such as
			<a href="http://espaciopublico.ong/fuera-del-aire-radio-fe-y-alegria-103-7-fm-apure/">persistent power
				outages

					<p>“After the shutdown of our station, there are no other independent outlets in the area …There is

					<p>“[CONATEL] came, accompanied by National Guard agents wearing bullet proof vests, and took

						asked them to leave the station alone. The agents were there from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., they
						destroyed everything and stole our equipment. We were shut down, ransacked, looted, destroyed.”

					<p>“CONATEL came with the National Guard, they took the equipment, they stole the equipment,

					<p>“With the shutdown of our station, RCR, the government acted more violently. Soldiers dressed as

						Nestares Phelps, Radio Caracas Radio 750 AM).
					</p>
					<p>“Operation Freedom happened on April 29, 2019, and it was frustrating. We covered it, as best and
						carefully as possible, considering how sensitive it was. The following day I received tens of
						calls from people telling me ‘forget about the radio, the order has been issued to shut you
						down.’ Two weeks later CONATEL arrived at the station, they violently unplugged and stole all of

						was there. It’s been a year, and I have never received any notification.” (Radio outlet owner,
